## About The App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Rick and Morty is an app that uses [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). 

On the Home Screen, you can see all characters with the main info about them. There is a possibility for authored users to like characters and open a page with more info about a character.

- you can log in or register via email or Facebook account. Use base email and password if you don't want to register but want to check how it works (email: user@user.com, password: user123456789) 
- use pagination to switch between pages and see more characters
- use autocomplete to find characters by their name
